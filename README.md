# The Generation Time Project

This repository contains the scripts to produce the data, figures, tables and perform statistical analysis included in the manuscript *Different historical generation intervals in human populations inferred from Neanderthal fragment lengths and patterns of mutation accumulation* in a Jupyter Notebook document ([GenerationTimeFiguresAndTables.ipynb](GenerationTimeFiguresAndTables/GenerationTimeFiguresAndTables.md)).  

To generate the [Data1_archaicfragments.txt](Data1_archaicfragments.txt) dataset, we followed the documentation on https://github.com/LauritsSkov/Introgression-detection.

To generate the [Data2_mutation_spectrum.txt](Data2_mutation_spectrum.txt) and other datasets, we run the scripts in https://github.com/MoiColl/TheGenerationTimeProject/tree/main/MutationAccumulation. For a detailed description, check the (derived_alleles.ipynb)[tree/main/MutationAccumulation/derived_alleles.md] Jupyter Notebook.
