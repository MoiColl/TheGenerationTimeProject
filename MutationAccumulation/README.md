# MutationAccumulation

This directory contains the scripts to produce the data for the analysis of the derived mutation accumulation. To understand step by step the pipeline, see [derived_alleles.ipynb](derived_alleles.ipynb) Jupyther notebook. The counts of all mutation types per individual is found in [mutation_spectrum.txt](mutation_spectrum.txt).
