# MutationAccumulation

This directory contains the scripts to produce the data for the analysis of the derived mutation accumulation. To understand step by step the pipeline, see [derived_alleles.ipynb](derived_alleles.md) Jupyther notebook. The counts of all mutation types per individual is found in [Data2_mutation_spectrum.txt](../Data2_mutation_spectrum.txt). Files that are used in the pipeline but not included in this github repository are open access and the link can be found in the notebook.
