# MutationAccumulation

All polymorphic sites were called in individuals included in Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) (check [SGDP.ind](SGDP.ind)) using the [`cpoly`](https://github.com/DReichLab/cTools) program. In this folder I provide an example of the initial files needed ([SGDP.ind](SGDP.ind) and [SGDP22.par](SGDP22.par)) to run `cpoly` for chromosome 22 as described in the [software Github page](https://github.com/DReichLab/cTools).
